# Simple Boto #

This repository was created to ease the use of `boto3` calls and combine some functionalities for a simpler package.


### Repository Best Practices ###
- All branch names should be of the form: `[feature|bugfix]/{TICKET}-{description}`.
- All code should be 100% unit tested and have docstrings and typing hints.
